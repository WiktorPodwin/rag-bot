Another corner contained an image of the globe and an homage to Lizzie's political hero, the economist Henry George, whose ideas about putting the burden of taxation on wealthy landowners inspired the game: 'Labor upon Mother Earth Produces Wages.' Also included on the board were three words that have endured for more than a century after Lizzie scrawled them there: GO TO JAIL.Lizzie drew nine rectangular spaces along the edges of the board between each set of corners. In the centre of each nine-space grouping was a railroad, with spaces for rent or sale on either side.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":1,"topic":"Others"}}

And, somewhat surprisingly, Lizzie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":3,"topic":"Others"}}

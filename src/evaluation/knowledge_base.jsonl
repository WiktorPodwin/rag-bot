{"text":"The Landlord's Game. Photograph: Tom Forsyth. Lizzie's game featured play money and deeds and properties that could be bought and sold. Players borrowed money, either from the bank or from each other, and they had to pay taxes. And it featured a path that allowed players to circle the board - in contrast to the linear-path design used by many games at the time."}
{"text":"In one corner were the Poor House and the Public Park, and across the board was the Jail. Another corner contained an image of the globe and an homage to Lizzie's political hero, the economist Henry George, whose ideas about putting the burden of taxation on wealthy landowners inspired the game: 'Labor upon Mother Earth Produces Wages.' Also included on the board were three words that have endured for more than a century after Lizzie scrawled them there: GO TO JAIL.Lizzie drew nine rectangular spaces along the edges of the board between each set of corners. In the centre of each nine-space grouping was a railroad, with spaces for rent or sale on either side."}
{"text":"Absolute Necessity rectangles offered goods like bread and shelter, and Franchise spaces offered services such as water and light. As gamers made their way around the board, they performed labour and earned wages. Every time players passed the Mother Earth space, they were 'supposed to have performed so much labor upon Mother Earth' that they received $100 in wages. Players who ran out of money were sent to the Poor House.Players who trespassed on land were sent to Jail, and there the unfortunate individuals had to linger until serving out their time or paying a $50 fine."}
{"text":"Serving out their time meant waiting until they threw a double. 'The rallying and chaffing of the others when one player finds himself an inmate of the jail, and the expressions of mock sympathy and condolence when one is obliged to betake himself to the poor house, make a large part of the fun and merriment of the game,' Lizzie said.From its inception, the Landlord's Game aimed to seize on the natural human instinct to compete. And, somewhat surprisingly, Lizzie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents."}
{"text":"Her vision was an embrace of dualism and contained a contradiction within itself, a tension trying to be resolved between opposing philosophies. However, and of course unbeknownst to Lizzie at the time, it was the monopolist rules that would later capture the public's imagination.After years of tinkering, writing and pondering her new creation, Lizzie entered the US Patent Office on 23 March 1903 to secure her legal claim to the Landlord's Game."}
{"text":"At least two years later, she published a version of the game through the Economic Game Company, a New York-based firm that counted Lizzie as a part-owner. The game became popular with leftwing intellectuals and on college campuses, and that popularity spread throughout the next three decades; it eventually caught on with a community of Quakers in Atlantic City, who customised it with the names of local neighbourhoods, and from there it found its way to Charles Darrow.In total, the game that Darrow brought to Parker Brothers has now sold hundreds of millions copies worldwide, and he received royalties throughout his life. ***Lizzy Magie's place in the game's folk history was lost for decades and ceded to the man who had picked it up at his friend's house - Charles Darrow.

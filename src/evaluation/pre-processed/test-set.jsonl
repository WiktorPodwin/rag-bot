This introduces greater flexibility by allowing the model to explore different generation strategies and obtain a more comprehensive selection.Second, to tackle the issue of inaccurate heuristic supervision of retrieval costs and the varying costs associated with different generation strategies, we design a dynamic, fine-grained reward function. This function penalizes inefficient generation strategies, even if they lead to correct results, ensuring that the model not only prioritizes accuracy but also optimizes computational efficiency.We evaluated our framework on both single-hop and multi-hop datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA generation accuracy while reducing retrieval costs by 20%.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":43,"topic":"Adaptive Retrieval in Language Models"}}
